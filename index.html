									<h3><em>Echoes in the Forge</em></h3>
									<h4>MFA Thesis, 2023</h4>
										</br>
										<p><i>On a future Earth ravaged by the fall of civilization, the descendants of the survivors 
										are forced to scrape out a living amid a century-long ice age. Five years have passed since 
										disgraced general Khess Lindhorne and her small group of loyal ex-soldiers fled from the 
										walled city of Greyhaven and took up residence at an abandoned outpost in the uninhabited 
										and brutal Northern Wilds. Just when she thought she was safe from her former king’s bounty 
										hunters, a mysterious stranger arrives to pass on a message from the city she once defended: 
										a revolution is brewing but doomed to be snuffed out in its infancy without a unifying leader. 
										Seeing an opportunity to atone for her failures, Khess accepts an offer to be that leader—and 
										run straight into what might be her own death. In Greyhaven, Duchess Estrid Ahmedani works from 
										within the king’s inner circle to nurture rebellion against a cruel tyrant. Knowing that success 
										rests on Khess’s return, she navigates a dangerous court determined to hold onto power by any means 
										necessary. Meanwhile, in the unknown reaches of the north, a world-spanning threat awakens from a 
										long slumber to fulfill a vengeful promise.</i></p>

								<h2>Biography</h2>
							</header>

							<img src="profile pic.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Meagan Trammell" /></a>

							<p><i><p>I began writing at 11 years old, filling notebooks in the middle of class with run-on sentences and terrible sketches at the exasperation of my lecturing teachers. I wrote my first novel at 13 and had parents who were supportive enough to submit it to an editor. Unfortunately, none of it went anywhere (sorry, Mom and Dad!) and that was probably for the best.</p>
	<p>I continued to improve my writing through high school and into college, where I switched my major for Graphic Design to Creative Writing 1 year in. I earned my AS in Fine Arts from Northern Virginia Community College in 2016 and was accepted into the Creative Writing Program at George Mason University, where I received my BFA in 2019.</p>
	<p>In 2023, after limping along for 4 years, I finally attained an MFA from GMU.</p> 
	<p>My major-adjacent career working in a library (all the way from page, to circulation, to information, to collection maintenance) has spanned my entire working life from 2015 to the present. The public library is where I realized my love of writing, appreciated the works of authors I hope to one day emulate, and, most importantly, where I met my fiance Merlin Ahrenadel, a Computer Game Design major.</p> 
	<p>I live with him in Northern Virginia, where I read and write far too much fanfiction instead of working on my own manuscripts.</p></i></p>
